## FAQ

#### What is Project Elric?

Project Elric is an entity that aims to bring people who are eager to improve this technological world we live in.
We want to build stuff that others (and ourselves, of course) would enjoy using without having to worry about their data being collected or sold.

#### So, everything is going to be free, right?

Well, yes but no.

We support free (as in freedom) and open-source (FOSS) software. Therefore, we want everything to be secure, privacy-first, free and open-source. However, this does not necessarily mean every software we develop is going to be also free in terms of pricing. Nevertheless, we promise to do our best regarding this matter.
